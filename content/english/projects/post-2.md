As a contributor to the open-source RuneLite plugin [Skull Timer](https://github.com/Teekiz/skull-timer), I worked on developing and enhancing a tool that tracks the player's skull duration and status in the MMORPG Old School RuneScape created by the British video game developer Jagex.

This project offered valuable experience through my passion for gaming in open-source collaboration, plugin development, and community engagement.
