## Introduction

As part of my coursework at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, I worked on the development of a full-stack application named [Quizzer App](https://github.com/Team-417-Expectation-Failed/QuizzerApp). This project provided hands-on experience into agile project management, full-stack development, and team collaboration.

This project was executed over three two-week sprints, each focusing on specific requirements provided by our Professor acting as the Product Owner. The experience offered valuable insights working as a part of a scrum team from the scrum master and developer perspective.

## Project Overview

The Quizzer App is an educational platform designed to facilitate the creation and management of quizzes by teachers, and enable students to participate in and review their answers. The application consists of two main components: a teacher dashboard for managing quizzes and a student dashboard for taking quizzes.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Scrum Master:** Led the team through agile and scrum events, including weekly standups, retrospectives, and deployment activities for two weeks.
- **Project Coordination:** Managed the creation of GitHub releases and ensured timely delivery of features by coordinating the project timeline.
- **Development:** Contributed to both the backend and frontend consistently throughout the course and spearheaded the final deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, H2, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, React, Vite
- **DevOps:** Docker

## Project Details

- **Teacher Dashboard:** Implemented features for adding, editing, and deleting quizzes, categories, questions, and answer options.
- **Student Dashboard:** Developed functionalities for students to take quizzes, receive feedback, and review their performance.

## Technical Requirements

- **Backend:** Implemented with Java using the Spring Boot framework.
- **Frontend:** Implemented with React.
